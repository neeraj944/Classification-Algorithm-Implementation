# Classification-Algorithm-Implementation
This project demonstrates the application of supervised machine learning algorithms to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset available in the sklearn library.

The goal is to compare the performance of multiple classification algorithms and identify which performs best on this medical dataset.
